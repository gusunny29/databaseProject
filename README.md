1. Project Name: Sports Association Database
2. Team Name: ChunnyGu
3. Names: Sunny Gu and James Chun
   Section 4
4. Brief Description: For this project, we are creating a database which is a directory for sports players and coaches within different sports associations. In the database, one can view statistics of both players and coaches within a specific team. In addition, there is a trade market in each association.

6. For the user data model, we will have a user who can either be a coach or a player. One can check a player's injuries, amount of years they played, and what position they play. In addition, one can see the amount of year a coach has played.
7. For our two domain objects, we have decided to create a team and trade market table. In this, one can see the name of the team, which conference it plays in, their wins and losses, and the players in it. In addition, one can see the trade market's open and close date along with the players within an association.
8. A user to domain object relationship we have implemented is with a player and a trade market. Within any sport association, there is a trade market where one can see whether a player is a free agent or not. 
9. The domain object to domain object relationship we have is between the trade market and the teams. A trade market can have multiple teams engaged in it.
10. The portable enumaration we have incorporated is within our user as a coach. Because there are multiple roles of coaches, we have classified 4 different types of coaches: Head coach, offensive coach, defensive coach, and assistant coach.
11. For P2. we plan on using Intellij to create a UI user friendly interface that allows users to access the different objects on the database (the league, team, trade market, etc) as well as perhaps add users, remove users, find users and display players and coaches.
